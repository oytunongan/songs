average energy is 0.65: not slow and not dynamic listener.
average valence is 0.44: listener is not very positive, a bit depressed.
average danceability is 0.71: listener might like dancing while listening.

I think the lyrics and meanings of songs must be checked as well beyond the song dynamics in order to be able to determine listener aura.
